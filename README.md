# Steady
A project that aims to give access to crypto enthusiasts whose countries have regulations restricting them from participating and earning incentives from testnets and airdrops
Those interested will interact with the website on the intended wallet for those sirdrops. They will provide the necessary findings while the feature will run most of the basic testnet tasks using an IP address that is outside the regulated area
